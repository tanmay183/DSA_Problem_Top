1. Introduction to Java
   Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed for simplicity, security, and
   portability. It allows developers to write code that runs on different platforms without modification. Java's
   principle is "Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)."


2. History of Java
   • Created by: James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (1995).
   • Initially called "Oak", then renamed to "Java".
   • It was designed to be platform-independent, meaning Java programs can run on any device with
   a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

4. Java Development Kit (JDK) in Java
   • JDK is a software development kit required to build Java applications.
   • It includes:
   o Compiler: Converts .java files to .class (bytecode).
   o JRE (Java Runtime Environment): To run Java programs.
   o Tools: Debuggers and other utilities for development.
   
5. JVM and Its Architecture
   • JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes Java bytecode on any platform. It's the heart of Java’s cross
   platform capabilities.
   JVM Architecture: LINK
   o Class Loader: Loads class files.
   o Memory Areas: Manages different memory sections like Heap, Stack, and Method Area.
   o Execution Engine: Executes the bytecode.
   o Garbage Collector: Automatically manages memory.

6. JDK Vs JRE Vs JVM
  • JDK (Java Development Kit): Contains everything to develop and run Java programs (includes JR + tools like a compiler).
  • JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Only for running Java programs (includes JVM and libraries).
  • JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Responsible for executing bytecode.

7. Just In Time (JIT) Compiler
   • JIT is a part of the JVM.
   • It improves performance by converting bytecode into native machine code at runtime, meaning
   it compiles portions of the code only when needed.

8. JIT Vs JVM
   • JVM: Runs Java programs by converting bytecode to machine code gradually.
   • JIT: A component of the JVM that compiles bytecode to machine code on-the-fly for better
   performance.

9. Bytecode Vs Machine Code
   • Bytecode: Intermediate code generated by the Java compiler (javac). It's platform-independent
   and executed by the JVM.
   • Machine Code: Low-level code specific to a machine's CPU. This is what the JVM ultimately
   converts bytecode into to run the program.
   


   Advantages of Java:
1. Platform-Independent: Java’s "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability allows code to run on any
   platform with JVM.
2. Object-Oriented: Promotes modular and reusable code through concepts like inheritance,
   polymorphism, and encapsulation.
3. Robust: Java handles exceptions and has built-in memory management via garbage collection.
4. Security: Java provides a secure execution environment and protection against unauthorized code
   execution.
5. Multithreading: Java supports concurrent programming, allowing multiple tasks to run
   simultaneously.
6. Rich APIs: Extensive libraries and APIs for almost anything you need, from networking to data
   structures.



   Disadvantages of Java:
1. Slower Performance: Compared to languages like C or C++, Java is slower due to the overhead of
   the JVM.
2. Memory-Consuming: Java applications can require more memory due to its garbage collection
   process.
3. Verbose Code: Java syntax is more verbose, requiring more lines of code compared to languages
   like Python.
4. Desktop GUI Limitations: Java is not the best choice for desktop applications with a rich graphical
   user interface (GUI).
